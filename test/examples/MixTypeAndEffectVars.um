# FIXME: There should be some kind system for type variables so we can tell if they're
# supposed to be types or effects
# This type doesn't make sense - what would it mean for the effect to match the type?
# This seems to cause weird behavior in the type checker
#let foo : (() -> <a> a) -> () = \_ -> ()
