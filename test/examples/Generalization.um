# We don't do local let generalization (or at least not properly) at the moment.
# This seems fine, might even be a good idea as it supposedly makes type-checking some
# things e.g. GADTs easier. If this ever gets annoying we can implement it.

let f : a -> ((a, Char), (a, Bool)) = \x ->
  let g y = (x, y) in
  (g 'v', g True)

let f x =
  let y = x in
  y

# FIXME: How come multiple `f`s are allowed here? That should be an error, right?
