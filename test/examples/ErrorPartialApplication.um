# TODO: Because of how function types are implemented in the type-checker right now,
# at generalization time `apply_arg` gets a type `(Int -> a) -> a`. Because there is no
# auto-currying, this is not compatible with a function like `bar : Int, Int -> Int`.
# We could potentially support more polymorphism for partial application by allowing
# generalizaed partial function types e.g. `apply_arg : (Int, .. -> a) -> a`. This would
# have to create a closure over the applied arguments.

let apply_arg f = f 1

let foo x = x * 2
let bar x y = x + y

let _ = apply_arg foo

# FIXME: It seems to be non-deterministic (or at least unstable) which of the following
# two lines are the cause of the error. Maybe it depends on the ordering of type variables
# or something?
let _ = apply_arg bar
let _ = (apply_arg bar) 7
