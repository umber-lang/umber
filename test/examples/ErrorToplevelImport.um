# This may look like the toplevel import here applies to the sig too, but it doesn't.
# I thought about implementing this but it seems a bit too gross. The standard should
# probably be writing imports below the file module sig. If having to write the imports
# twice turns out to be too much of a pain, we can consider implementing it. It's
# complicated because it's one more inconsistency between submodules and file-level
# modules, and there are problems like relative imports of things not exposed in the sig.
