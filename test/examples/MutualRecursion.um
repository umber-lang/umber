# Mutual recursion within a module is allowed for both types and let-bindings

# Types can be used before being defined

# FIXME: likely problem is generalizing too early - need to generalize them together, probably (?)
  Should see how Haskell does this
  May need to group mutually recursive functions together and generalize them at once
    => dependency graph?

  It works if the `forest` argument to `sum_forest` is written explicitly.
  (`let rec` can only be followed by a function definition, a constructor, or the `lazy` keyword.)
