# TODO: should the value (*) automatically get re-exported or do you have to write this:
# Maybe there could be a compiler directive at the top of the file to switch re-exports
  on, but have them off by default (seems like good behavior)
# Actually, I should just be able to use `include` instead of import: seems good
  Signatures can still be changed by adding them under `module :`
